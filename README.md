As a third-year IT student, Iâ€™ve built a strong foundation in the field and chose to specialize in Network Technology to further enhance my skills, particularly in how systems connect and operate efficiently within integrated infrastructures.

In studying System Integration and Architecture, I expect to learn how various technologies and platforms work together as a unified system. I'm especially interested in how scalable, secure, and maintainable architectures are designed, and how integration supports seamless business-IT alignment.

I also hope to gain hands-on experience and a better understanding of how to deal with real-world integration challenges. Learning both the basics and practical applications of system architecture will help me become more confident and prepared for future projects and roles in the IT field.
